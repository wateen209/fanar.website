#  Fanar | Smart Architectural Review Platform

**Fanar** is an intelligent platform that redefines the architectural design ecosystem by creating a unified interface connecting design studios, consulting offices, and regulatory entities through AI and IoT technologies.

---

##  The Idea

Fanar addresses four major challenges in the architectural design process:

1. Inconsistent expertise among consulting offices leading to variable design quality.  
2. Lack of digital coordination between parties, resulting in repetitive revisions and delays.  
3. Difficulty in aligning with municipal and environmental regulations for governance compliance.  
4. Absence of real-time environmental sustainability monitoring during project execution.  

---

##  The Solution

An intelligent web platform powered by **AI**, **NLP**, **LangChain**, **AR**, and **IoT** that:

- Analyzes building regulations and urban codes.  
- Provides smart design review suggestions.  
- Monitors surrounding environmental factors live using smart sensors.
